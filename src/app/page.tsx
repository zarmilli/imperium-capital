                    also. All this was fun but I got no certificate for it, so I couldn't get a professional job with that
                    experience. Shame man sad neh? No it's not, there's light mos at the end of the tunnel why you wanna cry?

                    get the NQF thingy thingy but hey, atleast recruiters get to see i'm not lying! I just didn't participate in the
                    other competitions because I didn't have a fancy looking setup, when I post I don't get views, you know all those 
                    confidence killing things... but I had to try this!

        The reason why I vested into knowing how to integrate reusable tailwind components is because
        they make my coding experience smoother honestly, and they're more dynamic, attractive, and modern. Look at how visually appealing this website has been.
        I do, however, have websites I coded over the months using basic HTML, CSS, and JS. Click on the projects button on the navigation bar to see them.
        I spent a lot of time styling that bar, I will now force you to interact with it.
